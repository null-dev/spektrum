## About
I haven't seen a nice HTML5 spectrum yet so I made my own!

It uses the new Audio API and the Javascript canvas to work it's magic!

## How to use
Too lazy to write this, check out the `index.html` example for how to do this (it's literally 3 lines of code to play a buffer!)

The main code is in `script.js`.
